### What I learned

I learned new techniques while creating a web calculator application, such as changing the body themes using toggles. I also gained knowledge on making websites more responsive through media queries. Additionally, I learned how to organize code effectively.

### Continued development

For continued development, I aim to focus on further refining my skills in web development, particularly in creating more complex and feature-rich applications. Additionally, I plan to deepen my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), as they are fundamental to efficient programming and problem-solving. By exploring these areas in future projects, I aim to enhance my proficiency and build a strong foundation for creating robust and scalable web solutions.
